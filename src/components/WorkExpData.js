        description: "I have been providing technical assistance for Professors from various fields ranging from Computer Science to Politics to Psychology. I picked up the programming languages and frameworks that they need, then helped them to automate the data collection and analytics processes. I mainly used Python and R, where I also employed various libraries such as Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, and TidyText. There were times when I needed to pick up new languages, such as Shell Script, to automate data collection from an open-source software. In every project I assisted, I have always found a way to develop the work."
